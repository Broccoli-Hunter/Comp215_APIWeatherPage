# Comp215_APIWeatherPage
Webpage that uses OpenWeather API to get weather for specified locations

Final project for Comp 215 / Internet Application Development I
* April 2021
* Grade = 100%

### Objective
* Create an HTML weather dashboard that uses JavaScript and AJAX to dynamically reload weather for 2 cities entered by the user
* Page calls OpenWeather API to get weather updates, and code applies the information from the JSON file returned into appropriate areas of the page

**NOTE:** 
1. I have not included my API key in the JavaScript file. To run this page, one would need to generate their own API key from OpenWeather.org and insert it at line 3 in the weather.js file. Get an API key at [OpenWeather API](https://openweathermap.org/api).
2. Since finishing this project, the OpenWeather API has implemented a fee structure for API use. Some of the information the page was originally developed for is no longer returned from the API call. I have made one change upon uploading the project to get the current weather sections functional, but the hourly forcast section is currently non-functional.
